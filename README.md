# TSA-DRA-tool

The Temporary Storage Area Drainage Rate Analysis (TSA-DRA) tool is a data-based mechanistic method for assessing the functioning of nature-based solutions (NbS). It requires only rainfall and Temporary Storage Area (TSA) water level or volume data, making it straightforward to apply across a wide range of sites.

The tool provides a systematic approach for characterising the functioning of a wide range of temporary storage area (TSA) types and sizes. The tool can also explore time-variable TSA functioning and provides useful soil infiltration estimates for modelling.
