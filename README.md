# TSA-DRA-tool
The Temporary Storage Area Drainage Rate Analysis (TSA-DRA) tool is a data-based mechanistic method that can assess the functioning of nature-based solutions (NbS) and only requires rainfall and water level / volume data.

The tool provides a systematic approach for characterising the functioning of a wide range of temporary storage area (TSA) types and sizes. The tool can also explore time-variable TSA functioning and provides useful soil infiltration estimates for modelling.
